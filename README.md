# E-Commerce Android Application

## Overview
This Android application is a full-featured e-commerce platform that allows users to browse, buy, and sell products. It demonstrates the implementation of modern Android development practices and architecture.

## Key Features
- User authentication and profile management
- Product browsing with categories and search functionality
- Product listing and management for sellers
- Shopping cart and checkout process
- Order tracking and history
- User reviews and ratings

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Kotlin
- **Architecture:** Clean Architecture with MVI (Model-View-Intent) pattern
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Coroutines
- **Networking:** Retrofit for RESTful API integration
- **Data Binding:** For efficient UI updates
- **Image Loading:** Coil library
- **Dependency Injection:** Dagger Hilt (you can add this if you used it in the project)

## Architecture
This project follows Clean Architecture principles, separating the app into distinct layers:
- Presentation Layer (UI)
- Domain Layer (Business Logic)
- Data Layer (Remote and Local Data Sources)

The MVI pattern is used for managing UI states and user interactions, ensuring a unidirectional and predictable data flow.
